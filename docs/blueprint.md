- Score Tracking: Track the number of valid Hist Sets for each player.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A warm, parchment-like beige (#F5F5DC) to evoke the feel of historical documents.
- Background color: Light beige (#FDFEF4), slightly lighter than the primary, creating a subtle contrast.
- Accent color: A muted burgundy (#800020), reminiscent of old leather-bound books.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel. Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Note: longer text is anticipated, so Playfair will be used for headlines and 'PT Sans' will be used for body.
- Use antique-styled icons, like inkwells, quills, and crests, for various actions and categories.
- Design a layout that mimics a tabletop card game, with a clean, uncluttered interface.
- Employ subtle animations like card shuffling, dealing, and flipping to mimic physical card game actions.
